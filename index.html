most of the people who see this website, at least initially, are people who i consider important to me. i don't mind others being here, as i will be speaking in anonymeity. for those who do know me, you may learn more about me than you knew initially, because i don't talk about this stuff out loud very often. if you want to talk to me about anything on hear, you are welcome to reach out to me.

"papabluebitch" is an odd name that I chose for an incognito account at one point in time. 
if you know me, you know it doesn't click.
im not a father, and im not a father character.
blue is my least favorite color. i will elaborate on this later. <!--insert entry number and hyperlink -->
"bitch" is a word you will not find me using very often - it holds more destructive power than i thought it did.
