                "papabluebitch" is an odd name that I chose for an incognito account at one point in time. 
                if you know me, you know it doesn't click.
                im not a father, and im not a father character
                blue is my least favorite color. i will elaborate on this later. <!--insert entry number and hyperlink -->

                most of the people who see this website, at least initially, are people who i consider important to me; however, i don't mind others being here, as i will  be speaking in anonymeity. for those who do know me, you may learn more about me than you knew initially, because i don't talk about this stuff out loud very often. if you want to talk to me about anything on hear, you are welcome to reach out to me.
